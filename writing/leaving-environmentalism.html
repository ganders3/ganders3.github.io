	<h2>Leaving Environmentalism</h2>

	<p>
		I used to be an adamant vegan. Not militant, but only because I knew how ineffective it would be to convert others. Plus I didn't want to get grouped in with PETA. They did it for the animals, but my cause was more noble - saving our environment. I did it for about a year, replacing meat with beans and tofu and feeling morally superior to the meat-eating Texans in front of me on the grocery line. The blind consumers willingly contributing to an unsustainable system. Eat a vegetable for once! Wake up and realize what you're doing!
		<br><br>
		I must have expended all my mental resources on moral posturing, because I failed to see my own blind consumption in the self-righteous ideology of environmental veganism. I came to this realization not through some revelatory moment of introspection, despite the plant-based crowd's claims of enlightenment. I first began to question my habits die to a very immediate concern - the explosive gas and bloating that plagued me near daily. Vegan friends assured me it would take some time to adjust. Ten months seemed like more than "some time." My less out-there friends said it was obviously all the damn beans I ate.
		<br><br>
		For reasons I can only attribute to martyrdom complex, I continued subjecting myself to intestinal trauma for several weeks longer. Maybe I bumped my head getting out of bed in just the right way to unblock the mental clog, and my friends' and family's concerns flowed through my mind with clarity. I resolved to get to the bottom of the issue, so I removed all but a handful of items from my diet and intended to study the effect. Foregoing meat, dairy, and eggs, and cutting bean products left me scraping the barrel for protein sources. So I opted to compromise my identity by losing the beans and eating eggs in their place. They were the least destructive animal product, according to my research.
		<br><br>
		My foray into mostly-veganism began with buying eggs by the hundred and trying to give away my fifty pound bags of beans to my friends. I didn't have any takers. Over the next year my experiment played out exactly like a reasonable person would expect. Eggs cured my bloating pretty much instantly. It probably wasn't the eggs so much as the removal of beans and daily pound-plus of veggies. I don't remember whether I was surprised.
		<br><br>
		Then I moved to a new city, and as often happens, a new place led to new habits. In my case it was a new return to old habits. Somewhere along the cross-country move to Maine I misplaced my short-term memory and started cooking with beans again. Tofu, tempeh, chickpeas and pintos had a new allure to them as I tried new recipes in a new place. The result was predictably disastrous.
		<br><br>
		When the novelty of Portland wore off I often found myself lonely and uncertain. Was pursuing seaweed farming the best way for me to positively impact the environmental crisis? I had left a comfortable career to pursue something I'd only seen in books and videos. When things were uncertain I clung to what I knew and loved - animal fat. With hesitance, I started eating meat again, acknowledging with unease that my personal health and happiness were requisite for making meaningful societal contributions. But my carbon footprint swelled and lingered over my mind like a cloud. I knew that if left unchecked, we would meet a sorry demise on a planet with its climate thrown into chaos, unless we changed our behaviors and ate fewer animals.
		<br><br>
		I started attending church in my search for a community. It met in an auditorium at the University of Southern Maine. The pastor wore a flannel shirt tucked into his jeans and spoke in regular, non-churchy sentences. Listening to bible readings and sermons was new to me, as opposed to sleeping through them as a kid. I began to understand the Christian perspective. Humans are fundamentally flawed and therefore need saving. By devoting their lives to being kind, caring, and seeking forgiveness, there can be salvation from eternal doom. It was inspiring stuff, if a little too alarmist. It also sounded an awful lot like the call to action of environmentalism, dressed up in different clothes and with better-tasting potlucks.
		<br><br>
		As meat-eating became normal again, I would occasionally attempt some rough mental carbon footprint calculations to appraise the damage of my pork sausage over bean stew. Let's see, there's the environmental cost of raising pigs, growing their feed, housing them, temperature control, transportation, processing, styrofoam packaging. On the other hand, beans requires a clear-cut field, a facility to â€¦ through my mental accounting I came to a confident conclusion. I had no idea what it took to raise animals and crops, and this was all nothing more than a fun thought experiment. Consulting the research didn't help much. There are convenient bar graphs that compare beef versus eggs versus vegetables, but they are vague about what constitutes things like "transportation," "cultivation," and "waste." A dive into research papers reveals that environmental impact estimates are based on statistical models which are in turn based on other statistical models, all of which make huge assumptions about production methods, scale, distance, and so on.
		<br><br>
		Even if a model happens to be correct, it doesn't account for my meat coming from South Carolina versus New Mexico or beans on a family farm or a thousand-acre plot in the midwest. What about when I didn't want to stand around the stove cooking beans so I opted for a can instead? Or if the my favorite flavor of pork wasn't in stock, and I chose to use gas to drive to another store? The ambiguity made it easier for me to digest my meat-eating, but harder to know whether I was doing the right thing.
		<br><br>
		The right thing used to be obvious. It was a gut reaction. Apologize to my brother for being inconsiderate. Give an old woman my seat on the train. Postpone my evening plans to help a grieving friend. So who was I helping or hurting in my food choices? I called out for an answer and the almighty carbon footprint responded. "You hurt everyone by choosing meat. It's reaping destruction on the planet." I'd followed this prophetic declaration before and my gut was the casualty. This time I sided with my gut feeling and questioned further. If meat was wrong, did that make meat farmers evil?
		<br><br>
		I had begun frequenting the Portland farmers market and met a beef farmer, several shepherds, and some poultry farmers. I ran down my super-villain checklist and came up empty. They were all completely decent people, as willing to laugh over a joke as they were to talk about how they raised their animals. Behind their booths, banners showed the farm's name and a family photo - grinning husbands, wives, and children. Sometimes the family members showed up too. Visiting the market became a highlight of my week.
		<br><br>
		I spent many days contemplating the state of the world - homelessness, joblessness, unhealthy relationships, discrimination, crime. My existential tendencies left me feeling helpless that I could help change these things, let alone stop the impending climatic doomsday. But each week at the market was a spark that ignited my motivation to continue caring about what was tangible and immediate - the people around me. There were fundraisers for community projects. Volunteers advocated for local issues. Low income families received bonus spending power on food, this gaining the opportunity to be integrated instead of marginalized.  The food bank picked up donations from farmers. Shopping music was provided courtesy of a homeless man known as The Master of Theology, who happily beat his drum and doled out cheerful greetings. "Today's a great day, why aren't you smiling?" he would ask passersby. It was hard for it to not be a great day. The sense of community was palpable.
		<br><br>
		One day I found myself leaving the market with canvas bags full of meat, as if I were under the sleepwalking spell of a vegan's nightmare. My worries of environmental responsibility were overtaken by fulfillment in community responsibility. The vague threats of the carbon footprint just weren't doing it for me anymore. The environment was still important to me. But I didn't care about fixing it. I cared about people, at the market or in town, whether we struck up conversation or simply walked past each other. I had gained a level of empathy for my community members, and an empowerment that small acts of humanity could have huge impacts. Sure, there's the climate to deal with, but a fragmented society will degrade from social discord long before the atmosphere becomes permanently altered. And if we want to address the climate in a meaningful way, social unity is the prerequisite. Buying meat from Farmer John down the road keeps the loop local. My money directly helps him and his family, who in turn have a concern for their community, and now have a little more means to act of their concern. It's unlikely that any of us will build a device to harness infinite clean energy, but we are at least operating within the circle we can control. What if we were to look away from technology to solve our problems, and look towards our own communities? That's a cause I could get behind and feel good about, in my heart and my belly.

	<h2>Frustraing Business</h2>

	<p>
		Sitting in traffic. Long lines at the grocery store. Paying too much for internet access. Rude customer service. There are plenty of things to complain about in daily life, and no shortage of audience. Others will happily to commiserate with us and rant through their own laundry list of gripes. Most of the time this frustration doesn't progress beyond complaining, and we go back to our routines more or less the same as before. There isn't much we can do, so it's easiest to put the problem out of mind. But for some, everyday frustrations have been the catalysts that spurred action. Three Seattle residents shared how their frustration led them to pursue their small businesses.
		<br><br>
		During a visit for a routine oil change, the mechanic emerges from the garage and warns of rusted brake lines. He describes the problem in cryptic terms and quotes a thousand dollars in repairs. Most of us aren't car-savvy, and mechanics know this. Leaving the auto shop with an uneasy feeling of having been had is relatable, as it was for Tony N. After working as an electrical technician, Tony changed course and became an auto mechanic because he was tired of being ripped off, saying that he would rather "play with [his] own cars."After studying at Shoreline Community College, Tony opened shop in Capitol Hill in 2004 and has since moved to Georgetown.
		<br><br>
		The nondescript garage has no sign to distinguish it from the other generic industrial buildings in the area. Cars are parked on the sidewalk outside, and more still are packed tightly into the garage, some suspended on car lifts or with their hoods opened. Even to a layperson the shop's equipment looks dated. At first glance it is in complete contradiction to the glowing positive reviews the shop garners on Yelp and Google Maps. But in a small office built into a nook in the garage is the man behind of the operation. Tony leans back in his chair, having just finished ordering a part for a repair job. He knows he could make more money as a mechanic, but he wants to help his customers and do what is right for them. "When we're doing a timing belt, everything has to come apart. We might as well do everything in there that needs to get done - water pump, everything. Then it'll last another hundred thousand miles. Some mechanics will just do the timing belt, then a few months later tell you to do the pump. You just paid them to do the same thing twice."
		<br><br>
		Tony offers candid advice to his customers, including advocating YouTube for simple repairs, and referring them to specialty shops for jobs that would be cheaper than his own method. He even keeps his line open for customers who were given diagnoses and estimates and are unsure of their trustworthiness. Turning down willing customers for their own benefit has caused no hiccups in his business. "I've worked a lot in my life. If the government went by hours, I'd have retired long ago." He is aiming to retire in the next five years. While his candor may come as a surprise, it means satisfied return customers and plenty of work to keep Tony busy until then.

		Expert mechanic or brand new driver, it makes no difference if the car is locked. The sinking feeling being locked out of your car is typically replaced with impatience and frustration during the time spent waiting for a locksmith to arrive. For Justin S., seven hours of waiting at an auto auction were enough for him to quit his moving business and train as an automotive locksmith. While he waited for his turn in the queue, Justin watched the locksmith move from car to car in the parking lot carrying devices with him. By the end of the day when his key was made, Justin had secured an apprenticeship with the man. He worked unpaid, 50 to 60 hours a week for eight months while learning the trade. Now seven years into his craft, Justin drives his mini cargo van to his customers' locations, a self-contained mobile workstation. The van is outfitted with a workbench atop neatly labeled metal drawers, with the digital key cutting machine the centerpiece. With the array of equipment, Justin's business is outfitted to make keys of all varieties, but his company works solely with car keys. "It allows us to be the best at what we do," he said.
		<br><br>
		Justin has trained an apprentice of his own, a childhood friend, who has since started his own locksmith business. He is training two others now, also old friends, without any expectation that they will stay with him for the long term. "I'm giving them an opportunity to earn more and create a better life than they had previously." Justin is glad to be able to give back to his friends now that he has secured a life for himself. From his work as a mover, Justin says "I know what hard work is. In comparison this isn't work at all - it's entertaining and fun." And it's certainly relieving for his customers, who can breathe a sigh of relief. "I'm a magician, and I do magic all day long," he said.
		<br><br>
		Justin's transition from his moving company may have been smoothed by the fact that in Washington, movers are more regulated than locksmiths - a fact he may have learned while submitting business paperwork. It's the same type of paperwork with which James R. was all too familiar. In the span of a year James applied for a job in Seattle while living abroad, got married, and bought a house. Each of these life changes came with myriad government paperwork, and James found himself submitting the same types of information again and again. "They needed the address of my school in Ottawa. I don't know that off the top of my head - well, I do now because I've had to look it up so many times." During the day James works as a data engineer, but he began spending the evenings on a software project of his own. "It's called Goodbye Government, although I want to change it to something more positive."
		<br><br>
		The project, called GG for short, is a software tool to automate filling of government forms. Users hold a file containing their personal data, and can download forms which will automatically be filled out, as well as upload new forms to build the database. At first James was unsure whether he could build his idea. "There was a big barrier in feeling I simply didn't have the skill set to do this." Frustration has been a big motivator - frustration at his time spent slogging through bureaucracy as a physicist in the Air Force. "There was [so little] work to do, and when there was it was usually paperwork that could easily be automated. Now I see the value of [those] negative experiences with seemingly no upside." Now that he's over the initial barrier, James is aiming to file for a business license. "The plan is to use GG to register GG as a business."
		<br><br>
		Everyday frustrations are stressful, but they can also spur us to make changes for the better. Besides the financial gain, solving a problem and mitigating it as a stressor for others is an intrinsic reward. "When my customers are happy and I know I helped them, I sleep well at night," Tony said with a satisfied nod.

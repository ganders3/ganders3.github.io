	<h2>Farming for Non-Farmers</h2>

	<p>
		"Greg! It's after 6, it's time to feed the calves!"
		<br><br>
		I woke with a start to see John standing in the doorway, and began emerging from the sleeping bag cocoon atop my bed. The cold air of the room was startling as I rifled through my bags for work clothes. I'd arrived late the previous night and fell right asleep.
		"Good morning. Uma is already outside, she'll teach you."
		I looked around my room as I got dressed. Two twin beds sat on antique bed frames, one of which I used as a desk of sorts for my clothes, books, and other loose items. The room had a fireplace which was blocked off. An old baby crib, wooden chairs, and ornately decorated wooden chests and wardrobes housed bags of clothes and boxes labeled in permanent marker. I wondered how many generations of belongings were in this room alone. Two large windows on either side of the fireplace flooded the room with sunlight, but it was not enough to deceive me from the freezing air which loomed outside - and had turned my room into a walk-in refrigerator.
		I dressed and made my way through the broad hallway, down the stairs, through the sitting room and dining room into the kitchen, passing hazy black and white photos, carved wood furniture and antique trinkets, but also strewn about with colorful modern children's clothes and toys. This was the accumulation of seven generations of who made this farmhouse their home since the Carter family settled in Bethel in 1791.
		In the kitchen, John was pouring himself coffee in front of the stove, a gargantuan beast of metal with six big burners and three heavy oven doors, more suited for a restaurant than a home.
		<br><br>
		"Lucy and the boys just left for school," John said between sips of coffee as I buttoned my coat. Along with his wife and their newborn daughter, John recently added three elementary school-aged stepsons to his life. That would explain some of the disarray I saw through the rooms and hallway, I thought.
		I tightened my boots and stepped outside, bracing myself for the cold, and made my way to the milking house where Uma would be working. The walk across the driveway was awkward in my multiple layers of pants and jackets, and bulky calf-high waterproof boots. The 50 yards between the farmhouse and milkhouse were covered in ice and snow, and the wind blew steadily, its frigid touch making apparent any exposed skin on my face. I was familiar with Maine in the wintertime, but the weather in Portland seemed temperate in comparison.
		Halfway across the drive I was greeted by a black and white dog who happily trotted about the snow and dropped a stick at my feet. Spencer, the family border collie, learned more about playing than working in a house with three young boys.
		I entered the milkhouse and shut the door on Spencer, ending his hopes of a frozen game of fetch. The buzz of the motor running the milking equipment dominated the room, and Uma gestured that there were two calves which needed to be moved out of the incubator. I followed her on foot while she drove to the rear barn in a skid steer, a wheeled vehicle resembling a mini bulldozer, with a wide front pail that can be hoisted with hydraulic lift arms. Inside the incubator were two newborn calves. One was anxious to leave the chamber, and began sniffing Uma's arms as she bent down into the incubator, instinctually grasping with its lips for a nipple. The other calf was dead. Its eyes had a milky gray glaze and its mouth hung limply, half open. The red light of the incubator shone onto its fur, which glistened with moisture along its neck and back. I was still coming out of my early-morning daze, but this sight expedited the process.
		<br><br>
		We guided the living calf into the pail of the skid steer and drove it to the calf huts, where Uma found an empty stall. The huts were white plastic domes with hay bedding, and a each calf was attached to an anchor point from a rope loosely about its neck.
		<br><br>
		Having settled the calf in its new holding cell, Uma and I made our way back to the milkhouse and I listened as she yelled over the motor to explain how to mix milk, hot water, and dry milk powder to make calf formula. We prepared five five-gallon buckets each of formula and water, loaded them into the skid steer's pail, and Uma drove them to the calves. I watched as the vehicle rumbled over the rough ground, sloshing milk and water out of the buckets.
		<br><br>
		We began feeding each of the thirty calves, giving each animal two plastic restaurant pitchers of formula in a colorful plastic bucket, except the large brown bull who received three. A few calves had not yet learned to drink out of buckets, so Uma fed these with bottles. The calves slurped their milk up right away, the heat from the buckets rising into steam to mix with the steam of the animals' own breath. Next I poured water into the same now-empty buckets, while Uma fetched two buckets of grain feed from the silo. The thin cylindrical pellets would be nibbled on by the calves, holding them over until their second meal at midday. Last, we replenished each hutch with fresh dry hay. This required crawling into the hut and spreading the hay evenly to ensure there were no damp spots, as a wet hide could be fatal in the winter weather.
		<br><br>
		In the momentary shelter the hut provided from the cold, I figured there had to be a better way to do this. Besides the sloshing buckets spilling a significant amount of milk and water, the tasks required manual dexterity that several layers of gloves did not afford. I could take off a glove to get the work done more quickly, but my hands froze nearly immediately in the brutal weather. With a calf standing a hand's length from my face as I encroached on its tiny dwelling, I decided that the two hours or so of this feeding process were nearly over, and the frigid conditions discouraged me from doing any further consideration of improving the process.
		<br><br>
		As I walked back to the farmhouse I saw two other farmhands at another barn up the hill working with the adult cows, feeding them and tending to their pens as I had with the calves, but on a much-bigger-animal scale. Those who were not seeking out hay or water were huddled in a tight cluster underneath the shelter of the barn.
		<br><br>
		In the house I was greeted by an excited Spencer, who barged through the kitchen to stand happily at my side. Willow, the overweight golden lab and Spencer's mild-tempered other half, got the impression that it was stand-at-Greg's-feet time and waddled over to me, making it more difficult to take off my boots and layers of jackets. I warmed my hands under the faucet and poured myself a cup of coffee. Lucy had made some cheese quesadillas, and I grabbed one before heading into the basement with John to learn how to tend to the wood stoves. The entire house was warmed with wood fires, which meant that the main stove in the basement as well as those at the front, rear, and kitchen all had to be tended every few hours. I had made a handful of fires in my life, but John's curt and confident explanation made it seem manageable. The most important thing was to throw in only dry logs from the wood pile when the fire was first building, to prevent it from fizzling out. The prospect of being left with a cold house made this an easy rule to follow.
		<br><br>
		After lunch we drove in John's red heavy-duty Chevy pickup to a drab-looking building where potatoes were kept in cold storage. Cold, I learned, meant the right amount of cold, not so much as to freeze them and cause decay. We opened the makeshift door - a plywood and two-by-four frame with pink insulated foam panels - and in front of me sat pallets of potatoes in enormous burlap bags, each as large as a small cow, my newfound unit of measurement. All five of us began sorting potatoes: John, Uma, and I, and the two other farmhands, Robert and Jeff. We set up 50-pound bags for large and small potatoes, and plastic crates for those rejected due to rot or damage. These would be fed to the cows. Beside us was a conveyor-looking contraption that resembled something like a miniature car wash made entirely out of metal and steel wire brushes. It was an automatic potato sorter, but there wasn't enough space for it to operate until we cleared out a few rows of potatoes, the equivalent of a dump truck's worth. I let the absurdity pass as I massaged potatoes, remembering my goal to learn and help, not change the world in a day.
		<br><br>
		A few hours of spud-handling later, we returned to the farm proper and began loading up coolers of meat for the next day's farmers markets. Spencer enthusiastically joined us, and I obliged him with a few tosses of the sticks and potatoes that he dug up.
		<br><br>
		Back in my room I huddled into my bed and considered the original premise of my visit: to build a database to keep track of the dairy cows' production, health, and breeding cycles. Although I did nothing of the sort on my first day, I had experienced a world of work that I was vastly unfamiliar with: real, physical, uncomfortable work.
		<br><br>
		Over the next week I familiarized myself with the calf-feeding operation, handling it on my own after a few days. I resigned myself to get the job done rather than attempt to improve it, so that I could focus at least some of my time on the computer work that continued to evade me with the apparent urgency of running a farm in the dead of winter.
		<br><br>
		Working intimately with the calves gave me a sense of normalcy in the unfamiliar circumstances I found myself in. I began to learn the temperaments of the animals: which were skittish and which were aggressive about getting to their milk before I placed the bucket on the ground. I spent several hours of each day with them as I fed, watered, and cleaned their stalls. On occasion the milk or water would make its way through the layers of my gloves as I handled the equipment, or a calf would headbutt a pail out of my hands and onto my pants. My instinct was to feel enraged at the sensation of water turning to ice on my skin, but this was soon replaced with a more somber thought.
		<br><br>
		I was no cow, so I could only assign my own human senses to the experience, but it was one of vast discomfort. The harsh wind, snow, and cold made for a very bleak existence, especially, I imagined, when separated from one's mother and herd and roped to a plastic attempt at shelter. As I knelt to feed a young calf who pressed its body to me and suckled from the bottle, I put my bare hand on its flank, feeling the warm of its body and the hardness of its ribs through its muscled side. This animal would have three possible futures: killed for veal within months, raised for beef for a few years, or if it was female, live a life of twice-daily milkings and birthing offspring who were wrested from it.
		<br><br>
		Working with the calves became a time for reflection on my decisions and an attempt to reconcile my actions with my conscience. I determined that farming, even in its least industrialized form as I experienced here, was inherently exploitative of animals as mere commodities. Two personal solutions came to mind: hunting my own food, and raising my own animals on the smallest scale possible. These courses of action would be easy to consider from in front of a computer in a cozy warm apartment, while doing some leisurely reading after a day at the office. In fact, I had had that very thought process in those very circumstances not more than a few months ago. From my meager shelter within the hood of my over-sized parka it was much harder to avoid the practical considerations that would come with this decision: taking an animal's life, permanently using its existence to sustain my own.
		<br><br>
		In the evenings John had discussed with Lucy and Uma that there was a sick cow that was not getting better, and I became used to occasional news and status updates on the "sick one." I expected its illness to play out over weeks, so I was surprised when John came down the stairs one day and sighed, saying, "well, I gotta go shoot a cow." My heart jumped for a few beats at the idea, but my words came out almost on their own: "I'd like to see." John dismissed it, saying it's sad and disturbing and that I wouldn't want to be there. I explained that I'd never killed an animal and I wanted to understand how it felt. He assured me, "naw, trust me, you don't wanna if you don't hafta." I felt disappointed but respected his decision. I went back to my lunch, and a few minutes later John came into the dining room and asked, "Greg, do you really want to see this?"
		<br><br>
		I put my food down and followed John out into the kitchen. He picked up the shotgun from its place in the corner of the room and was on his way out the door. I threw on my coat and boots as quickly as I could. He was already a hundred yards ahead, wading through the snow with the shotgun propped over his shoulder. I hastily made my way over the ground, careful not to slip on the ice patches. John turned to his right towards the barn on the far side of the farm, where the lambs, pigs, and quarantined cows were kept. Spencer caught sight of me and began loping through the snow in my direction.
		<br><br>
		"No Spencer, not now." He followed alongside me for several strides as I discouraged him from following me, feeling anxious at his inopportune request for attention, before he ran off in another direction.
		<br><br>
		I passed the first barn where the milking cows were huddled together. The sounds of huge shuffling feet sloshing through mud and slushy water stood out amid the quietness of the day. The air was nearly still. In the distance to my left, a few calves stood outside their hutches, perhaps enjoying a break from the oppressive winds. My heart raced in my chest.
		<br><br>
		John made it to the barn and was no longer in sight. I shuffled my feet all the way to the barn's wide opening. The adjustment from bright sunlight reflecting on snow to the relative dimness within the barn caused my vision to blur. In the instant it took for my eyes to adjust, a huge piercing bang penetrated my ears, and the smell of gunpowder immediately joined to overwhelm my senses. John stood halfway down the row of stalls, lowering his gun to his side and turning to walk in my direction.
		<br><br>
		I ducked under the rusty bars of the metal gate into the barn walking past the pigs and lambs in their large stalls, and asked, as if the sound and smell hadn't been obvious, "that's it?"
		<br><br>
		"Yep," John said curtly as he walked towards the exit.
		<br><br>
		I continued past John, deeper into the barn, and stopped in front of the dead cow. It was laying down on all fours, its front legs tucked underneath it, where it rested, a marvelously complex being, living, breathing, and thinking only moments ago. Blood poured out of a small hole in its forehead in a steady flow, sounding like the trickle of a lazy stream. I caught my breath as the tension of the last three minutes dissipated. The animal's eyes were open and stared contently ahead. Its head rested gently in front of its legs. It looked remarkably comfortable, considering its circumstances. Had I not been present for its execution I would have assumed it to be taking a mid-day nap.
		<br><br>
		After a minute I pulled myself away from the scene. On the far end of the barn, a few cows ate from their haystacks. The lambs were huddled together, sleeping. Many of the hogs were similarly unaware, propped on their sides in a pile while others sloppily foraged through their muddy trough. I ducked under the bars again, leaving the shelter of the barn. I was suddenly aware of just how cold it was. I zipped up my parka and secured my hood tightly over my head to face it.
